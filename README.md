## 📺 Tutorial

I made a video to show you exactly how it works (and to prove how easy it is). 

*When I first downloaded files from GitHub, I had no idea what to do with them. If you feel the same way, this video is for you!*

## 📖 About

**Let’s be honest:** The terminal can be scary. 😱

When you're just starting with programming, the last thing you want to do is stare at a black screen and memorize cryptic commands. `CD` this, `NPM` that... it’s exhausting!

**NPM COMMANDER** is here to save your sanity. It’s a friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) that takes the "scary" out of Node Package Manager. It turns complex terminal commands into big, shiny, clickable buttons. 

No more typing. No more memorizing. Just drag, drop, and code.

## ✨ Features

- **🚫 No More Terminal:** Bypass `npm install`, `npm run dev`, and other commands entirely.
- **🖱️ Drag & Drop Magic:** Simply drag your project folder into the app. No more `cd ../../../` nightmares.
- **👀 At-a-Glance Packages:** See exactly what packages are installed in your project visually.
- **👆 One-Click Actions:** Install dependencies, build your project, or start your dev server with a single click.

## 📸 Preview

See it in action! Here is the interface that stands between you and the command line:
